Question1:
- It took about 4 hours, time was mostly spent on deciding what data structures to use and then implementing them.
- Got lot of insights on how to programme SAT problems
- I think question was perfect.

Question2:
- It took about 6 hours, some time was spent on tuning. Like for example WalkSat was not working very good if I updated number of satisfiable clauses,
instead it worked way better if I put a threshold and used it.
- Programming SAT solvers and fine tuning them
- not really

Question3:
- It took about 3 hours and I hardly finished it half way through.
- Problem I had with this Question was that since while doing first question I didnt know about details of this question,
the data structures I implemented before couldnt be used in this. for example my dictionaries for literal values only supported true of false.
 So doing this question required me to alter all those datastructures and I thought ten points were too few to do it.
- I think this sheet should have had a specification list for datastructures, which could support both SAT and CSP problems
 (SAT literals had only boolean values while CSP literals had integer domains)
