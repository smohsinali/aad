question1:
-about 3 hours
-i didnt had experience with numpy so it was good intro exercise for that
-i think exercise in implementing neural network would have been more fun
-compared to one of my friend im getting very good scores (in range 0.85-0.96) so im in bit of doubt if there might be some problem in my implementation. if rough result for one of dataset was provided then i could be sure.


question2:
-about 3 hours (time was mostly spent in waiting for results and making small changes to get them in right format)
-i learned how frustating can it be to tune params especially if size of datasets start growing
-it was nice exercise, i wouldnt change anything

question3:
-about 3 hours
-all time was spent in downloading, starting and running vm
-i didnt fully understand the output of classifier.show_models() so i cant say i learned much
-i also wonder if one hour was enough for autosklearn. apparently results i got in it (0.52 and 0.48) are worse than ones i get with simple knn

question4:
-about 2 hours
-very open ended
-i liked the question but in the end lacked the time to properly do it
